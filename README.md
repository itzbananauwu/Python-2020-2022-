# Grade11_School_Year-2020-2021-
Despite not being able to take another computer science elective course this school year. I decided to continue and play around with python and try new ideas from time to time just to not become detached from programming. Furthering my interest, I also decided to register for the Waterloo Junior Canadian Computing Contest for the first time (solutions to practice problems can be found in this repository)!
